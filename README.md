# phpcode

cringy php code I have had for years since 2013, before I knew a thing about systems programming (:

-dbclass: a database engine that ran entirely in PHP code, allows to encrypt/decrypt database and save/restore to/from file.
-encryphhhhption: an encription layer added to raw filestream, used by dbclass.
